# Feature-Model Batch Analysis
This repository can be used to analyze a batch of feature models using FeatureIDE. The feature models can be of any format that is supported by FeatureIDE, namely the FeatureIDE format (xml), SXFM, UVL, and DIMACS.
As input a path to either a directory or a feature-model file is expected. If given a directory path, the tool computes the metrics for every feature model in the directory *recursively*.
